# Property-price-prediction-system
Introduction:

Welcome to the Property Price Prediction System! This project aims to provide accurate and reliable property price estimates using machine learning techniques. The system offers valuable insights for potential buyers, sellers, and investors in the real estate market, empowering them to make informed decisions in property transactions and investments.Features:

Real-time Property Price Prediction: Get immediate price estimates by inputting property details through the web application's user-friendly interface.
Accurate Predictions: The machine learning model has been fine-tuned and optimized to provide accurate predictions based on relevant features and market indicators.

Requirements:
Python 3
Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn (machine learning libraries)
Jupyter Notebook

Installation:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Data Preprocessing and Model Training:

The property price prediction system's core functionality is based on a trained machine learning model. The data preprocessing and model training steps have been executed using Python scripts provided in the repository. For further details on these steps, refer to the documentation or Jupyter Notebooks included in the project.

Evaluation and Results:

The system's accuracy and performance have been evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics. The results are detailed in the project documentation.
